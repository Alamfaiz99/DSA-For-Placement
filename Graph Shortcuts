1)Mother Vertex-->You will be able to reach all the nodes from that node than it is mither vertex
 concept is-->Start from single point-->apply DFS
 The node you wont be able to reach-->That means No intermediate node has access to it
 Thats why-->It will be a candidate vertex...
 Atlast Apply dfs on candidate and check it it reaches all the nodes or not-->
 If yes then return true;
