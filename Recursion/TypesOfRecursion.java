/*
 * Lets talk about the type of recursion in java
 * Tail Recursion-->
 * When recursive call is the last statement then it is known as tail recursion...
 * Head Recursion-->
 */

 /*
  * How to understand and approach problem?
    Step1:Indentify if you can break down the problem into smaller problem
    step2:Write the recurrance relation
    Step3:Draw the recursive tree
    Step4:About the tree
       1)See the flow of problems 
       2)How they are getting into the stack
       3)Identigy and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
       4)Draw the tree and position pen and paper again and again
    Step5)See how  the value is returned
