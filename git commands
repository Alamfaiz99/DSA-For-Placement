Lets say we are in a marriage..
We have to click a picture...(working directory)
Right now we are on backstage..(Working directory-->add)
Now we have to come on stage.. (Staging area-->comming)
After clicking the picture we will come out of the stage..(central repo)

-->lets say you are on stage(-->added)
-->Now i want you to go backstage(-->git stash)-->will take u to the back stage
-->Means my project flder was as it is-->like at the starting

-->In order to bring back all those changes we can use
  git stash pop-->

-->This is known as stashing-->means putting changes on the stack and when needed takethe changes back
