To optimize the code and avoid the time limit exceeded error, you can implement a more efficient approach that avoids repeated rotations of the string.
You can calculate the net rotation needed for each character in the string and use that information to answer the Type 2 queries directly. Here's the optimized code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Character> StringQuery(int N, int Q, String S, int Q1[], int Q2[]) {
        ArrayList<Character> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int netRotation = 0; // Initialize net rotation to 0

        for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
            if (Q1[i] == 1) {
                // Type 1: Rotate the string by K characters from the end
                int K = Q2[i] % N;
                netRotation = (netRotation + K) % N;
            } else if (Q1[i] == 2) {
                // Type 2: Print the character at the I'th index
                int I = (Q2[i] - netRotation + N) % N; // Adjust the index
                result.add(S.charAt(I));
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

In this optimized code:

1. We maintain a `netRotation` variable to keep track of the net rotation needed for the entire string.

2. For Type 1 queries, we calculate the net rotation required by adding the given rotation `K` to `netRotation`. 
Since we only keep track of the net rotation, we use modulo `N` to ensure it stays within the bounds of the string length.

3. For Type 2 queries, we adjust the index `I` by subtracting `netRotation` and adding `N` to ensure it's within the bounds of the rotated string.

This optimized approach processes each query in O(1) time, resulting in a total time complexity of O(Q), which is within the expected time limit.
