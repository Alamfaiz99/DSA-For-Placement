-->perform type checking at the compile time
   compile time-->conversion of source code into machine code is known as compile time.
   int a=10;
   int name="faizan"//return error
   "faizan" is not an int its string
-->error will be shown at the compile time
-->declare data type when you use it
-->more control
-->You will get compile time error
public void foo() {
    int x = 5;
    boolean b = x;//compile error-->because boolean can take only True and False value
}
int a=10;
a="faizan"
You will get an eroor because you have defined a as integer

Dynamic
-->Perofrm type checking during run time
-->Error might not shown till te program is run
-->No need to declare datatype in dynamic programming
-->saves time during writing the program but may give error during run time
   a=10
   b="faizan"//at run time it will check for the data type
